web-audio-stream
================

NOTE: node.js, wget, ffmpeg and libspeex are required for these examples to work.

The following directories are a set of examples that I've created to show how to stream live audio to a client using web audio rather sending whole audio files to the clients to be played back.

I've included two seperate audio types as examples: uncompressed PCM audio and Speex encoded audio.
